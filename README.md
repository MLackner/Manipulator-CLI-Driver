# Manipulator-CLI-Driver
LabVIEW driver for the PreVac 5-axes manipulator via the CLI

## Dependencies

Depends on the <a href="https://github.com/MLackner/ManipulatorCLI">manipulator command line interface</a>.
The `manipulator.exe` file has to be on `PATH`.

Additionally you will need the `ManipulatorDLL.dll` file from PreVac. This has to go in the `Windows\SysWOW64` folder.
